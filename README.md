# Retail-Sales-Analysis
This project presents a full-scale business analytics case study based on a retail Superstore dataset (2015–2018). The objective was to identify key revenue drivers, seasonal patterns, customer concentration effects, geographic imbalances, and logistics performance — and translate analytical findings into actionable business recommendations.
